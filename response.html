          Hello everybody, welcome back to CyberSAFE. This is the third lesson on Recognizing and Responding to Cyber Threats
First, let’s talk about common threats that arise in the healthcare industry
There are three major categories of cyber threats: attacks that exploit IT infrastructure vulnerabilities, including attacks like SQL injections, where hackers exploit weaknesses in software to gain unauthorized access to databases, attacks with intentions of disrupting service and holding data hostage, including ransomware attacks which encrypt data and demand a ransom for its release, and the exploitation of human vulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive data, using things like phishing links, where attackers trick individuals into revealing confidential information through deceptive media.
Now let’s talk about recognizing threats.
It is essential that employees know how to recognize symptoms of threats. 
Using security risk assessment tools can be an effective way of finding where your protected health information could possibly be at risk
Be careful of any media that is sent to you, whether they're emails, messages, links, or other things. Check if it looks suspicious at all, especially the sender themselves. Also watch out for any emails or messages requesting sensitive information from you as well. 
Network monitoring for any unusual activity additionally helps when recognizing cyber threats.
Now let’s talk about responding to threats, starting with immediate action.
Upon detecting a breach, immediate steps should be taken to contain the threat. This includes unplugging network cables, disabling wireless connectivity, shutting down affected servers and updating firewall settings to prevent further spread​. This includes all passwords, especially those for administrative accounts, which should be changed immediately. This step ensures that any stolen credentials are rendered useless and that attackers are locked out of the system.  In addition, reporting is crucial when it comes to cyber attacks. This not only helps with managing the incident, but you may also be able to be provided guidance and support from experts and other organizations. Evidence may need to be preserved as well for the previous reason, so a thorough investigation can be conducted to find the underlying reason behind the attack.
Now let’s talk about recovery
I can’t stress enough how important data backing is. Use clean backups to restore systems and ensure all security gaps are addressed before bringing systems back online. This includes applying all necessary patches and updates, and configuring systems to adhere to best security practices. Monitoring network traffic post-incident is crucial to ensure no residual threats remain​. 

Ensure ongoing compliance with relevant healthcare regulations such as HIPAA. This involves regular audits, risk assessments, and maintaining proper documentation of all security measures and incidents. Compliance not only protects patient data but also helps avoid legal penalties and maintains the organization’s reputation​

Develop and refine comprehensive incident response and disaster recovery plans. These plans should outline clear steps for detecting, responding to, and recovering from cyber incidents, so employees know how to act in the case of a threat. Regularly reviewing and updating these plans based on the latest threats and industry developments ensures they remain effective and actionable
Why?
As you have probably heard a lot from me previously, the healthcare industry contains rich and sensitive patient data, and every last bit of it matters. By recognizing the threat and taking the right steps to handle it, you can reduce the impact that cyber attacks would have, for example the amount of data compromised by the attack and the financial losses suffered from it. It can also prevent secondary attacks, as cyber threats can serve as entry points for additional attacks as well.
