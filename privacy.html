            Welcome back to CyberSAFE. This is the last lesson, being on data protection and privacy, so let’s get right into it.

            First off, let's start with the idea of data minimization in the healthcare industry. Data minimization is the idea of collecting only enough data that is necessary for the specific purpose. Personal data should be "adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed." This is done to avoid excessive data collection, which in turn reduces the risk of data breaches.
            
            
            Now let’s talk a little about the policies concerning data privacy.
            
            As previously stated in the second lesson, HIPAA is a U.S. regulation that sets standards for the protection of health information. It enforces healthcare organizations to have safeguards ensuring the privacy of patient data via the Privacy Rule. For example, HIPAA requires healthcare providers to implement secure data storage and transmission practices, ensuring that patient information remains confidential and is only accessible to authorized personnel.
            
            
            Now let’s talk about data protection.
            
            I already went through a lot of this in the previous lesson, but data is best protected with best practices, like data backing/encryption, and generally having more aware employees, who know the ins and outs of cybersecurity. Data encryption keeps data private from anybody who somehow gets their hands on it, clean data backups can save information that may have been stolen, and having more aware employees will result in less fatal cybersecurity mistakes being made (for example employees falling for phishing/malware or having easy to access accounts)
            
            While we have discussed various methods to protect data in previous lessons, it's essential to focus on the concept of data privacy itself. Data privacy is about ensuring that personal information is handled in a way that respects the rights of individuals. In healthcare, this means that patient data must be managed with utmost care, confidentiality, and ethical responsibility.
            
            Obtaining proper patient consent is crucial for any activity in the healthcare industry involving data. You must receive informed consent from any patient before using data. Informed consent is consent from a patient after fully understanding how their data will be used. Of course, this includes the purpose of data use, who will access the data, and potential risks and benefits that may be involved. This consent can also be revoked at any time.
            
            Data confidentiality is also super important. Make sure you are following all policies and protocols to keep data safe.
            
            Additionally, it is necessary that you understand data subject rights. Data subjects have the right to access data collected on them, with the data-controller having to respond to them within 30 days of the request, the right to modify their data if necessary, and so much more, and as mentioned previously, data subjects have the right to stop their data from being processed. Data subject rights are usually always absolute, unless under special circumstances, an example being when data is processed for the purposes of investigating or preventing criminal offenses.
            
            Lastly, make sure that data is used ethically, following all policies and protocols. 
            
            
            Anyways, thank you for listening to me. This has been an amazing journey, and I hope you enjoyed this experience. CyberSAFE out.
