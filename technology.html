            Welcome back to CyberSAFE, today we will be talking about the secure use of technology in the healthcare industry in our fifth lesson. Let’s get started. First let’s talk about its importance.

            As you have seen previously, cyber attacks on the healthcare industry can have devastating consequences on organizations. Healthcare organizations handle vast amounts of sensitive patient information, including medical histories, personal identification, and financial details. Protecting this data is crucial to maintain patient confidentiality and trust. A breach of this information can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and significant personal distress for patients​. 
            
            Healthcare organizations are required to comply with regulations such as HIPAA in the United States. These regulations mandate specific security measures to protect electronic protected health information (ePHI). Using healthcare technology in a way that goes against healthcare policies can result in severe legal penalties, fines, and loss of accreditation​. 
            
            Healthcare operations rely heavily on technology for everything from patient record management to diagnostic and treatment tools. A cyber attack that compromises these systems can halt operations, leading to significant financial loss and potentially endangering patients' lives due to delays in treatment and care. 
            
            And as you may remember in the first lesson, human error is one of the leading causes of data breaches. By becoming more aware of cybersecurity and how to securely use technology in healthcare organizations, you can decrease the odds of a cyber attack occurring and the destructiveness of one in the case that it does happen.
            
            Now that we know why it’s important, let’s now take a look at how you can securely use technology.
            
            Strong passwords are the first line of defense. Ensure that passwords are complex, and implement multi-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security, reducing the risk of unauthorized access in the case that a password is compromised.
            
            Secondly, always keep your software up to date. Regular updates and patches fix security vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit. Schedule regular maintenance windows to apply these updates across all systems
            
            Encrypt data both at rest and in transit. This ensures that even if data is intercepted or accessed without authorization, it remains unreadable without the decryption key
            
            Additionally, be careful for unsolicited emails or messages sent to you requesting sensitive information or containing suspicious attachments. ALWAYS verify the authenticity of the sender before clicking on any media attached or providing information.
            And as previously mentioned in the last lesson, data backing is crucial in mitigating the effects of cyber threats. Even if data is stolen somehow, as long as data is backed then the losses aren't as serious.
            
            Thank you for listening, and have a great day! I’ll see you at the last lesson of our program.
