          Hello everyone, welcome to the first CyberSAFE lesson, and today we will have an introduction for healthcare cybersecurity. So, let's begin with the intro. Healthcare cybersecurity involves protecting healthcare systems, networks, and devices from cyber threats that could compromise patient safety and privacy. This field focuses on ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient data, which is crucial for maintaining trust in the healthcare system. So now, let's talk a little about the importance of healthcare cybersecurity. Cyberattacks are a major global problem with an increase of approximately 300% more attacks in the last three years, and that only a few cyberattacks enter the public domain since many go unreported.
individuals typically commit cyberattacks with the intent to steal money, intellectual property, or data. With a rich source of data, the healthcare industry is one of the most targeted industries globally and is exceptionally weak in terms of cybersecurity. Let's get a little bit more in to why the healthcare industry is a prime target. As mentioned previously, patient information, including medical records, social security numbers, and payment details, is highly valuable on the black market. Cybercriminals can use this information for identity theft, fraud, and other malicious activities. Healthcare facilities use a variety of devices and systems, many of which are interconnected and need to be accessible for patient care. This complexity makes it difficult to secure all endpoints effectively. Many healthcare organizations rely on legacy systems that are no longer supported or updated, making them vulnerable to attacks. The reliance on outdated technology is often due to the high cost and potential disruption of upgrading systems. Now, about the consequences of cyber threats in the healthcare industry, cyber threats targeted at the healthcare industry add unnecessary financial burdens on healthcare facilities, which already struggle with high expenditures and low-profit margins. Additionally, access to medical information can lead to identity theft, medical fraud, extortion, and the possibility of illegally obtaining controlled substances Just a statistic to show how bad this problem is: Over 110 million patients in the United States had their data compromised in 2015 alone. Surprisingly enough, a majority of data breaches occur from employee carelessness. A majority of the literature regarding healthcare cybersecurity agrees that human error is the leading cause of data breaches. End users, such as employees, have proven to be weak links in protecting organizations against certain cyber threats. They can be threats regardless of their intentions. Malicious insiders know the strengths and weaknesses of the cybersecurity systems in place, and non-malicious insiders are susceptible to threats such as phishing links which act as gateways for cyber attacks. For example, in a study of over 900 breaches in 2010, researchers found that insiders who were either current or former employees were responsible for approximately 48% of all breaches, with only 10% of the breaches being unintentional. So, what should you expect in future lessons? In future lessons, we will be covering topics like: 
Recognizing and responding to certain cyber threats, like phishing and ransomware
Important policies and protocols to consider in day-to-day activities in the healthcare industry like HIPAA, HITECH, and other stuff
Learning how to securely use technology in the workplace setting,
and so much more!
Our journey only starts here, and thanks for listening everybody! I'll see you at the next lesson.
